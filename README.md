### Ingredients

to serve 2.38 people:

* 500 grams of minced meat
* 1 egg (remove and throw out the shell)
* 25 grams of breadcrumb
* pepper, salt, nutmeg
* oil or butter
* 390g of tomato sauce
* about 1 liter of water (or enough to cover the spaghetti)
* 100gr of dry spaghetti

### Step 1: Make the meatballs

[![Step 1c](img/thumb_step1c.png)](img/step1c.jpg)


Put the minced meat, egg and breadcrumb in a bowl, add salt, pepper and nutmeg<br>
to taste and mix well.  Then form balls of roughly equal size. An ice-cream<br>
scoop is surprisingly useful to measure roughly identical volumes.<br>

Next, heat up some oil or butter in a pan and fry the meatballs on all sides<br>
over medium heat.

### Step 2: Add tomato sauce

[![Step 2c](img/thumb_step2c.png)](img/step2c.jpg)

Slowly heat up the ready-made tomato-sauce in a pan, together with the finished<br>
meatballs from Step 1.

### Step 3: Cook spaghetti

[![Step 3b](img/thumb_step3b.png)](img/step3b.jpg)
[![Step 3c](img/thumb_step3c.png)](img/step3c.jpg)

Boil water with salt and add the spaghetti so that the spaghetti is fully under<br>
the waterline.  Stir the spaghetti so it doesn't clump together.  Let boil for<br>
the required amount of time (See the package the spaghetti came in, probably<br>
around 10 minutes)

### Step 4: Show off your work and enjoy
[![Step 4a](img/thumb_step4a.png)](img/step4a.jpg)

Serve the spaghetti together with tomato sauce and meatballs on a plate.

Don't forget to add a **handwritten** note with:

* Your team name
* The words "OverTheWire Advent Bonanza 2018"
* Holiday greetings
